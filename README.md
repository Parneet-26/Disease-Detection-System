## 2.Description
Disease Prediction using Machine Learning is the system that is used to predict the diseases from the symptoms which are given by the patients or any user.This project aims to implement a robust machine learning model that can efficiently predict the disease of a human, based on the symptoms that he/she posses.The system processes the symptoms provided by the user as input and gives the output as the probability of the disease.\
In this project we have tested three models which include decision trees, random forest and naive bayes. Out of these Naive bayes if giving highest accuracy. Na√Øve Bayes classifier is used in the prediction of the disease which is a supervised machine learning algorithm.\
With an increase in biomedical and healthcare data, accurate analysis of medical data benefits early disease detection and patient care.
## 3. Input/Output
Input are the symptoms that are provided by the user.\
Output is the disease based on the input symptoms.
